# Monero JavaScript API (under development, not ready for use)

## Introduction

Monero wallet and daemon JavaScript API.

Modern JavaScript APIs for:

- A wallet that scans the blockchain locally and does not share the view key (requires a node running monero-daemon-rpc)
- A wallet that shares the view key with a MyMonero-compatible server to remotely scan the blockchain (**future consideration)
- A wallet that relies on a monero-wallet-rpc endpoint
- A daemon to query the Monero blockchain
