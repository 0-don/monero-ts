v0.0.3
test structure of daemon tx vins and vouts
daemon can determine if key images can be spent
remaining daemon tests

send(configOrAddress, amount) which supports {} and MoneroSendConfig
standardize tx note over description
test that note is set if specified in send config
todos throughout code
outline data model for review
license headers
block comments with params and formatting
report rpc issues
model daemon vouts
daemon.getTxsByHeight(), daemon.getTxsByRange()
multisig
common tx tests need cleanup
daemon.getBlocksById(), default implementations
time profiling
review/optimize rpc requests
getAccounts() fetches balance even if only thing needed are account indices
investigate performance of get single tx by id, way too many requests
support and test unlock time unlocks
common MoneroModel which can be initialized from and export state
merge asserts type
rpc impls _build.. -> _decode..
all model set functions return this
support send priority
set subaddress getUnspentOutputCount() with outputs assigned
how to handle 'confirmations' block height to add the tx to the chain if unconfirmed? corallary of unlock time?
don't wrap single return fields with MoneroDaemonModel? e.g. fee
support sweep_single (output)
handle excess undefineds and enable deepEqual() in testWalletTxCopy()
safeguard all apis by heavily validating input parameters
don't get tx hex unless requested
JS now has native BigInt class which could be used instead of current BigInteger
way to throttle rpc requests with agent instead of throttle-request to preserve stacktrace?
send to multiple, suggested_confirmation_threshold outgoing payment 6 but incoming payments 1; large discrepency
switch to jest?
remove text-encoding dependency
support setting daemon log level
csv export of types
daemon vins like vouts?
response getIsTrusted() -> getIsUntrusted()? semantic difference?
refactor copying to not be downward of a tree rooted at tx but instead correct per each part of a graph

test response info for transactions, transfers, and vouts
test daemon getIsCoinbase()
test getting coinbase txs by id
test response info of wallet.getTxs()
tests are unecessarily creating new accounts which degrades test performance
test notifications hardwired to account 0 which gets emptied by reset tests
test all tx fields in daemon, update tests to be like wallet
test json serialization / deserialization specifically, stringifying in between so cannot be any live objects

BIG PICTURE
transfer project?
make javascript feature complete, including multisig
report rpc issues
fix transfers bug #4500 in wallet rpc
data model outline
mymonero javascript wallet
local wallet / refactor wallet2.h
port javascript to java
implement java jni adapter
integrate with bisq
port javascript to go & implement jni binding to integrate with openbazaar

LOCAL WALLET / BROWSER
build process to not read mymonero-core-js build and contrib to browser build
update on save B-)
in wallet implementation: "prepend the last 3 blocks, should be enough to guard against a block or two's reorg" pull_and_parse_next_blocks
binary_blocks_to_json property_tree conversion throws memory exception if too big
split BooleanSet into new project
package asm for browser build under different directory (MyMoneroCoreBridge.js:740)

RPC
update #4500 with latest notes
fix #4500 subaddresses occluded by outgoing counterparts when sent from/to same account
unconfirmed tx missing destinations even though known by wallet
send from/to same account, after first confirmation outgoing tx amount is 0 but has payments with amts, so discrepency
show_transfers returns unconfirmed outputs
duplicate outgoing transfers returned for different subaddress indices, way to include subaddress indices?
introduce way to identify change output from blockchain? that solves unknown sent amt issue
identify one call per acount/subaddress and support "all" flag
/get_transactions returns duplicate data per transaction
daemon get_txs prune documentation missing
